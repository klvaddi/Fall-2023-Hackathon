# Emergency Eagle (KnightHack's Fall Hackathon 2023)

Devs: Simon Tran, Lokesh Vaddi, Istiaqul Alam, Hemant Kanoujia

Goal: The users for this application are civilians and paramedics. A civilian creates an account with their medical data. When they are in an emergency situation, they can press the SOS button to find the nearest ambulance and send the paramedics their medical data and location. Both users will be able to see each other's location in real time.  

My (Lokesh Vaddi) Contributions:
- Improved practicality with addition of medical data
- HTML for Navigation Bar and Settings Page to enter medical data
- Helped with functionality of other front-end components
